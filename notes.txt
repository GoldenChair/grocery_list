Should grocery list contain a list of build_row_widgets that is in home_page ui
Plus button should display a widget on top of previous widget to add a build row widget
sliding list item should delete it

Good for testing vars in a widget
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          // Retrieve the text the that user has entered by using the
          // TextEditingController.
          content: Text(inputMap.toString()),
        );
      },
    );
